						<h2 class="pseudo-classes-title title">Pseudo-classes</h2>
						<p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected
							element(s).</p>
						<p>Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document
							tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator, the status of its
							content , or the position of the mouse .</p>
					</div>
					<div class="pseudo-class-hover">
						<h3 class="pseudo-class-hover-title title">Pseudo-class - :hover</h3>
						<p>The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but
							does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the
							cursor (mouse pointer).</p>
						<div class="hover-example example">
							<p>Please hover over this link:</p>
							<div class="hover-link">
								<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com.ua/" title="Link">https://www.google.com.ua/</a>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>Styles defined by the :hover pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related pseudo-class
							that has at least equal specificity.</p>
						<p>With the help of a pseudo-class :hover, you can show hidden objects.</p>
						<div class="hidden-examples">

						</div>
						<div class="pseudo-class-hover-note note">Note: The :hover pseudo-class is problematic on touchscreens.
							Depending
							on the browser, the
							:hover pseudo-class might
							never match, match only for a moment after touching an element, or continue to match even after the user
							has stopped
							touching and until the user touches another element. Web developers should make sure that content is
							accessible on
							devices with limited or non-existent hovering capabilities.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="pseudo-active">
						<h3 class="pseudo-active-title title">Pseudo-class - :active</h3>
						<p>The :active CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the
							user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse
							button.</p>
						<p>The :active pseudo-class is commonly used on a and button elements. Other common targets of this
							pseudo-class include elements that are contained in an activated element, and form elements that are being
							activated through their associated label.</p>
						<p>Styles defined by the :active pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related pseudo-class
							that has at least equal specificity. To style links appropriately, put the :active rule after all other
							link-related rules.</p>
						<div class="pseudo-active-example example">
							<p>In order to see the effect of the pseudo-class, click on the link or button and do not release it.</p>
							<div class="pseudo-active-link">
								<a href="#">I'm a link</a>
							</div>
							<div class="pseudo-active-button">
								<a href="#">I'm almost a button</a>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="pseudo-active-note note">Note: On systems with multi-button mice, CSS specifies that the :active
							pseudo-class must only apply to the primary button; on right-handed mice, this is typically the leftmost
							button.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="pseudo-visited">
						<h3 class="pseudo-visited-title title">Pseudo-class - :visited</h3>
						<p>The :visited CSS pseudo-class represents links that the user has already visited. For privacy reasons,
							the styles that
							can be modified using this selector are very limited.</p>
						<p>Styles defined by the :visited pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related
							pseudo-class that has at
							least equal specificity. To style links appropriately, put the :visited rule before the :hover and :active
							rules.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="pseudo-target">
						<h3 class="pseudo-target-title title">Pseudo-class - :target.</h3>
						<p>The :target CSS pseudo-class represents a unique element (the target element) with an id matching the
							URL's fragment.</p>
						<p>The :target pseudo-class can be used to highlight the portion of a page that has been linked to from a
							table of contents.</p>
						<div class="pseudo-target-example example">
							<h2 class="target-example-title">Some header for example</h2>
							<ul class="target-example-lsit">

					<div class="pseudo-child">
						<h3 class="pseudo-child-title title">Pseudo-class - :first-child, :last-child & :nth-child().</h3>
						<p>The :first-child CSS pseudo-class represents the first element among a group of sibling elements.</p>
						<p>The :last-child CSS pseudo-class represents the last element among a group of sibling elements.</p>
						<div class="pseudo-child-example example">

							</ol>
						</div>
						<p>The :nth-child() CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on their position among a group of siblings.</p>
						<p>Note that, in the element:nth-child() syntax, the child count includes children of any element type; but
							it is
							considered a match only if the element at that child position is of the specified element type.</p>
						<p>:nth-child() takes a single argument that describes a pattern for matching element indices in a list of
							siblings.
							Element indices are 1-based.</p>
						<p>odd - keyword value represents elements whose numeric position in a series of siblings is odd: 1, 3, 5,
							etc.</p>
						<p>even - keyword value represents elements whose numeric position in a series of siblings is even: 2, 4, 6,
							etc.</p>

						<h3 class="pseudo-not-title">Pseudo-class - :not.</h3>
						<div class="pseudo-not-info">
							<p>The :not() CSS pseudo-class represents elements that do not match a list of selectors. Since it
								prevents
								specific items from being selected, it is known as the negation pseudo-class.</p>
							<p>The :not() pseudo-class has a number of quirks, tricks, and unexpected results that you should be aware
								of before using it.</p>
							<p>The :not() pseudo-class requires a comma-separated list of one or more selectors as its argument. The
								list must not
								contain another negation selector or a pseudo-element.</p>
							<p>There are several unusual effects and outcomes when using :not() that you should keep in mind when
								using
								it:</p>
							<ul class="pseudo-not-list">
								<li>Useless selectors can be written using this pseudo-class. For example, :not(*) matches any element
									which is not an
									element, which is obviously nonsense, so the accompanying rule will never be applied.</li>
								<li>This pseudo-class can increase the specificity of a rule. For example, #foo:not(#bar) will match the
									same element as the
									simpler #foo, but has the higher specificity of two id selectors.</li>
								<li>The specificity of the :not() pseudo-class is replaced by the specificity of the most specific
									selector in its
									comma-separated argument of selectors; providing the same specificity as if it had been written
									:not(:is(argument)).</li>
								<li>:not(.foo) will match anything that isn't .foo, including html and body.</li>
								<li>This selector will match everything that is "not an X". This may be surprising when used with
									descendant combinators,
									since there are multiple paths to select a target element. For instance, body :not(table) a will still
									apply to links
									inside a table, since tr, tbody, th, td, caption, etc. can all match the :not(table) part of the
									selector.</li>
								<li>You can negate several selectors at the same time. Example: :not(.foo, .bar) is equivalent to
									:not(.foo):not(.bar).</li>
								<li>If any selector passed to the :not() pseudo-class is invalid or not supported by the browser, the
									whole rule will be
									invalidated. The effective way to overcome this behavior is to use :is pseudo-class, which accepts a
									forgiving selector
									list. For example :not(.foo, :invalid-pseudo-class) will invalidate a whole rule, but :is(:not(.foo),
									:not(:invalid-pseudo-class)) will match any element that isn't .foo.</li>

						<h2 class="pseudo-elements-title title">Pseudo-elements</h2>
						<p>A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected
							element(s).
							For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.</p>
						<div class="pseudo-elements-note note">Note: In contrast to pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes can be used to
							style an element based on its state.
						</div>
						<p>You can use only one pseudo-element in a selector. It must appear after the simple selectors in the
							statement.</p>
						<div class="pseudo-elements-note note">Note: As a rule, double colons (::) should be used instead of a
							single colon (:). This distinguishes pseudo-classes from
							pseudo-elements. However, since this distinction was not present in older versions of the W3C spec, most
							browsers
							support both syntaxes for the original pseudo-elements.
